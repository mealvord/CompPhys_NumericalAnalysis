    "# Part 1: Defining Knowns and Unknowns in Code (variables and data types)  \n",
    "Knowns and Unknowns in physics are, simply put, variables. In coding, variables are a container that store information. There are several variable types we will explore through this course, but for now, simply think of them as a box with a name, type, and value. Naming variables is important. Each variable is named so it is clear which variable is being used at any time. It is important to use meaningful names for variables. Some guidelines include:\n",
    "- Consistency: ‘name’ is not the same as ‘Name’ or ‘NAME’.\n",
    "- Spacing: variable names should not have a space in them. Use underscores or camelCase instead, eg total_money; totalMoney).\n",
    "- Digits: variable names should not start with a digit\n",
    "\n",
    "In physics, variables are typically numbers (though not always). To store numbers in code, we have to use the appropriate data type. There are 5 data types in code: \n",
    "- String (or str or text). Used for a combination of any characters that appear on a keyboard, such as letters, numbers and symbols.\n",
    "- Character (or char). Used for single letters.\n",
    "- Integer (or int). Used for whole numbers.\n",
    "- Float (or Real). Used for numbers that contain decimal points, or for fractions.\n",
    "- Boolean (or bool). Used where data is restricted to True/False or yes/no options.\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the list above, which data types were typically used in your previous physics class? \n",
    "\n",
    "After defining the name and type, your variable is ready for a value. This value should match the data type. \n",
    "\n",

    "Now back to that greyhound. Let's say that our greyhound needs to race a 400 m track and can run at 15 m/s. If we want to find the time it takes to complete the race, this is a really simple problem. However, the method we will use to solve this problem is called numerical analysis and a very powerful tool. There are multiple numerical analysis techniques, but we will focus on the Euler method for now due to being conceptually easier. "
